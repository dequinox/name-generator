# name-generator

In this project we present an algorithm through which we can procedurally generate a range variety of original names. The core of the algorithm relies on Markov chains. Given a set of training data, the name generator calculates the probability of each word segment appearing after a previous segments and iteratively joins them to generate a new name. The generator is suitable for generating all sorts of names
